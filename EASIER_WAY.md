# Easier Way to Get Connection String

Since you're having trouble finding it in the dashboard, here's an easier approach:

## Option 1: Check Your Email

When you created the Supabase project, Supabase might have sent you an email with:
- Project details
- Connection information
- Database credentials

**Check your email** for a message from Supabase with subject like:
- "Welcome to Supabase"
- "Your new Supabase project"
- "Project created"

## Option 2: Reset Your Database Password

If you're not sure about the password, you can reset it:

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ulzykrzlkahzxwyfyete/settings/database
2. Look for **"Database password"** section
3. Click **"Reset database password"** or **"Generate new password"**
4. Copy the new password
5. Then we can use that password

## Option 3: Use Supabase CLI (Advanced)

If you have Supabase CLI installed, you can get the connection string that way.

## Option 4: What Do You See?

Can you tell me:
1. When you go to Settings → Database, what sections do you see?
2. Do you see anything about "Connection string", "Connection pooling", or "Database URL"?
3. What's the exact page title or URL when you're in the Database settings?

This will help me guide you to the right place!

## Quick Check

Also, please **double-check the password**:
- Is it exactly: `cympx-bocdec-4Suqqe`?
- No extra spaces before or after?
- Did you copy it correctly when you created the project?

Let me know what you find!
